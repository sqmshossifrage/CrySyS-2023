# CrySyS Security Challenge 2023

I played [CrySyS Security Challenge 2023](https://secchallenge.crysys.hu/) during the last two weeks and had a great time. Now it's time for writeups! 

Since it's against the rule to provide one-click solutions to challenges, I would rather call my "writeup" a "long hint".
